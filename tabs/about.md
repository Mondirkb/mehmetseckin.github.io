## Mehmet Seckin
_Software Engineer, Consultant_

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my website.

I'm a Software Engineer working as a Lead Consultant at [Hitachi Solutions Europe](https://www.hitachi-solutions.co.uk). My current areas of focus are enterprise cloud software architecture, Microsoft Azure and Power Platform. I design and build effective, scalable and extensible solutions that make people's lives easier.

I like to spend my free time reading, playing with my kids, working on my pet projects, contributing to open-source software, exploring new things and blogging.
