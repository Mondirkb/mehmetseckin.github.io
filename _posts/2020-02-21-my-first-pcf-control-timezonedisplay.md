title: 'My First PCF Control: TimeZoneDisplay'
---

PowerApps Component Framework is a new way to build helpful, reusable components that provide better user experiences in an efficient and maintainable way. I have been looking for a PCF control idea to learn and explore this new framework and its capabilities.

Recently, I have missed a series of international webinars due to my timezone miscalculations, and decided to address this with a PCF control. This is how the Time Zone Display was born.

Time Zone Display is a simple control that allows you to convert a date or datetime field to any given time zone. It's built using `React.js` and the Office UI Fabric components.
